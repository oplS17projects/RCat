This is an exercise in writing an exploit in Racket to demonstrate its flexibility.
We will approach writing an exploit from scratch using Racket from port scanning to shell.


We will target SLMail 5.5, a version of SLMail (from ~2003) that is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack.
There is plenty of public exploits available for SLMail 5.5; here are two links to code archived
in the exploit-database, both of which have been written in C. The exploit database is a reputable source of 
public exploit code for security researchers.

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/646/

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/638/

Each of these also contain a link to the SLMail 5.5 binary so you can learn install the vulnerable service
to learn the mechanics of the attack by hand.

We will require a couple tools outside of our Racket tool belt, these include
*       Metasploit Framework ; 
        A security auditing framework written in ruby on rails that will 
        generate supplementary code to help both fuzz and return a shell.
        Metasploit can be installed on Windows or popular Linux distros,
        we will use Kali Linux which has Metasploit as well as all of its dependencies.
        
        Windows XP virtual machine;
        We need a machine with a debugger installed. 
        I will use Immunity Debugger which allowes us to create custom python plugins. 
        We will also use an imported plugin for Immunity caled Mona.py
        Windows XP is a security nightmare, but the lack of ASLR will make writing this exploit easier.

Consider we have used a portscanner (such as RCat) and discovered a mail server sitting on a target machine.
Using some version matching we find out this server is a SLMail server.


The exploit is trigged by passing a buffer of characters too large for the program to handlewhen it is expecting 
a password for the user -- ie the input for the password variable is never checked to be a valid size for the 
container holding it. When this container overflows it will spill over into adjacent memory, and due to the way
the memory has been written onto the stack we will overwrite the EIP register.
This is the whole attack in a nut shell, by being able to direct where we take our next instruction from
we might have a chance to redirect the execution flow to our own code.

Here are the steps we will take to exploit SLMail:
1. Fuzz the service
..* We need to determine exactly how many character's breaks SLMail, this is one of the most important 
        factors in determining an exploits viability but this only leads us to the next question
2. Where -exactly- in our string, do we overwrite the EIP?
..* Once we determine where in our string the EIP is, we can use this to redirect the execution of SLMails code.
this means if we injects code into the surrounding buffer we might be able to carefully write string that overwrites
EIP to direct the next instruction to fall in our buffer of attack code.
3. Are there bad characters we need to avoid?
..* Before 
       

### Using the REPL to fuzz SLMail
```racket
> (define (fuzz n)
        (if (displayln (read-line in))
            (begin
              (displayln "USER test" out)
              (flush-output out)
              (displayln n)
              (displayln (string-append "PASS " (make-string n #\A)) out)
              (flush-output out)
              (displayln (read-line in))
              (sleep 1)
              (loop (+ n 100))) (displayln (string-append "Broke at " n))))
> (fuzz 100)
